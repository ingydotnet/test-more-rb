= test-more - Test::More for Ruby

A port of Perl's ubiquitous Test::More TAP testing framework.

= Synopsis

Write files ending with +.t+ under +test/+, like +test/test1.t+:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    $:.unshift "#{Dir.getwd}/lib"
    require 'test/more'
    include Test::More

    # plan 'tests', 3

    pass 'Yessss'
    ok true, 'yup'
    is 1, '1', 'one'

    done_testing

Then run the tests with the +prove+ utility like this:

    prove -v test/

You can test this gem with:

    rake test
